# Athlete identity + bio for the athletes who appeared in a season. Until
# 2026-08-03 this dataset had NO R producer: it was the one released dataset
# only the Python pipeline could build, which is a parity gap under the
# dual-pipeline policy. Closing it needed the projection to exist in hoopR
# first (hoopR::espn_basketball_player_core), because this repo's rule is that
# ESPN JSON parsing lives in hoopR, not here.
#
# What the season partition MEANS: "the athletes who appeared in season Y, with
# their CURRENT bio". The season dimension is participation -- it is NOT the
# bio's vintage. ESPN overwrites height/weight/jersey in place, so era-correct
# bio is not obtainable from any ESPN endpoint, and current_team_id is the
# athlete's team TODAY, not their season team (that lives in player_box).
