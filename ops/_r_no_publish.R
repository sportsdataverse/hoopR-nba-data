# Run one R creation stage with publishing made IMPOSSIBLE.
#
# The espn_nba_*_creation.R stages call
# `sportsdataversedata::sportsdataverse_save()` unconditionally -- there is no
# dry-run flag -- so simply running one against a machine with credentials
# publishes to the live sportsdataverse-data release. That is how the WNBA
# sibling's 2025 pbp/shots/team_box assets were overwritten on 2026-08-07;
# this wrapper exists so the same mistake cannot happen here.
#
# Blanking GITHUB_PAT is NOT the fix: the save is wrapped in
# `purrr::insistently(rate = rate_backoff(pause_min = 60, max_times = 10))`, so
# an unauthorized upload retries for ~10 minutes per dataset before failing.
# Replacing the function is both instant and fails CLOSED -- a parity run cannot
# reach a release even when valid credentials are present in the environment.
#
# Usage:
#   SDV_PARITY_STAGE=R/espn_nba_02_team_box_creation.R \
#     Rscript ops/_r_no_publish.R -s 2025 -e 2025
#
# The stage's own `-s/-e` flags pass straight through: optparse reads
# commandArgs(), which this wrapper does not consume.
