"""Stage 05 -- player_season_stats.

Mirrors ``R/espn_nba_05_player_season_stats_creation.R`` -- same stage number, same dataset.

Thin shim over the tested build package: the pipeline logic lives in
``nba_data_build``; this file exists so the stage sequence is readable from a
directory listing. It lines up with ``R/espn_nba_05_player_season_stats_creation.R``.

Equivalent to::

    python -m nba_data_build --dataset player_season_stats -s <start> -e <end>
