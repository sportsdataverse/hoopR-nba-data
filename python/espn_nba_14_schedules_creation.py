"""Stage 14 -- schedules.

**No numbered R stage produces `schedules` on its own.** R emits it inside ``R/espn_nba_01_pbp_creation.R``, ``R/espn_nba_02_team_box_creation.R``.
Numbered after the R range so the shared 01-13 numbers keep meaning
the same dataset in both languages (never compact a hole).

Thin shim over the tested build package: the pipeline logic lives in
``nba_data_build``; this file exists so the stage sequence is readable from a
directory listing.

Equivalent to::

    python -m nba_data_build --dataset schedules -s <start> -e <end>
