"""Stage 16 -- player_core.

**No numbered R stage produces `player_core` on its own.** No R file references it at all -- this is an open PARITY GAP.
Numbered after the R range so the shared 01-13 numbers keep meaning
the same dataset in both languages (never compact a hole).

Thin shim over the tested build package: the pipeline logic lives in
``nba_data_build``; this file exists so the stage sequence is readable from a
directory listing.

Equivalent to::

    python -m nba_data_build --dataset player_core -s <start> -e <end>
