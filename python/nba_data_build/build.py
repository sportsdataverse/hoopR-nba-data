"""Per-season build driver -- polars port of the R ``nba_<dataset>_games(y)`` loop.

Enumerate season game-ids -> read each final.json -> reshape (delegating to
the sdv-py producer) -> drift-safe union -> write -> (opt) publish. Per-game
failures are swallowed (R tryCatch parity) so one bad payload can't sink the
season.

Build-order note (NBA delta): ``player_season_stats`` reads player_box's
already-built parquet to backfill athlete identity, so build ``player_box``
before ``player_season_stats`` for a season (see ``reshapers.player_season_stats_builder``).
