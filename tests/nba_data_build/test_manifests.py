"""Build manifests carry one row per season.

Ported from wehoop-wbb-data/tests/wbb_data_build/test_manifests.py, which
caught this defect there: the R creation scripts wrote manifests with
`data.table::fwrite(..., append = TRUE)` -- a blind append with no dedupe --
so a re-run of a season leaves a duplicate row instead of replacing it.
Anything counting rows ends up counting RUNS, not seasons.
