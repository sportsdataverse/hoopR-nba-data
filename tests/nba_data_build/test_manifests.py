"""Build manifests carry one row per season.

Ported from wehoop-wbb-data/tests/wbb_data_build/test_manifests.py, which
caught this defect there: the R creation scripts wrote manifests with
`data.table::fwrite(..., append = TRUE)` -- a blind append with no dedupe --
so a re-run of a season leaves a duplicate row instead of replacing it.
Anything counting rows ends up counting RUNS, not seasons.

#: A build manifest is identified by its SHAPE, not its filename.
#:
#: The `*_in_data_repo.csv` suffix is ALSO used by real per-game datasets:
#: `nba/schedules/nba_games_in_data_repo.csv` is ~31k rows x 78 columns of
#: actual games. Selecting by filename swept that in and demanded one row per
#: season from a per-game dataset -- a test that cannot pass, and whose only
#: "fix" would be deleting real data. The pre-existing
#: `if "season" not in frame.columns: skip` guard did not save it either,
#: because the games file HAS a season column.
#: The CORE signature only. `source_endpoint` is present on some manifests and
#: absent on others (wehoop-wbb-data has both 3- and 4-column manifests), so
#: requiring it excluded four real manifests there -- caught by
#: `test_the_shape_filter_only_excluded_wide_datasets` below, which exists for
#: exactly this failure. These three still discriminate cleanly: the per-game
#: schedule datasets that share the filename suffix carry neither `row_count`
#: nor `generated_at_utc`.
MANIFEST_COLUMNS = {"season", "row_count", "generated_at_utc"}

#: Deliberately prefix-agnostic. `_is_manifest` does the discriminating, so
#: requiring a `<league>_` prefix here would only re-introduce a filename
#: assumption -- and it would MISS misnamed manifests, which exist: several
#: mbb stages write `mbb/<dataset>/nba_<dataset>_in_data_repo.csv`, so a
#: `mbb_*` glob silently skips exactly the files most likely to be wrong.
