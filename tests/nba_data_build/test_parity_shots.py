"""Parity: Python shots vs the R-released parquet oracle, FULL 2025 season.

Port provenance: the shots block of ``espn_nba_01_pbp_creation.R`` (filter
``shooting_play == TRUE`` on the compiled season pbp, project the 15 shot
columns). Oracle: ``hoopR-nba-data/nba/shots/parquet/shots_2025.parquet``
(292,933 rows), derived from the full 2025 pbp build. The shot rows have no
unique key, so ALL columns are sort keys (total order; duplicate rows compare
fine as multisets).
