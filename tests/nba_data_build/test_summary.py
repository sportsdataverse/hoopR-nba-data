"""Run summary: Python port of R/run_summary.R (kept in-repo as the rollback path).

The log format is the contract. The R producer emits
``Updated YYYY ESPN LEAGUE <ds> GitHub Release``; the Python producer emits
``uploaded <file> -> <tag> (asset N/M)``. Both must be recognised -- the R
rollback path still writes the former, and dropping it would silently report
0 updated on any R run.
