"""R <-> Python stage parity.

Standing policy (2026-08-03): this repo carries BOTH pipelines. Python is
primary and gets the work; the R chain is maintained as the methodological /
language equivalent; **both move together when either changes.**

The two sides decompose differently on purpose — R is dataset-per-file
(``R/<league>_NN_<key>_creation.R``, usually with an ``espn_`` prefix), Python
is a build package with datasets as ``config.REGISTRY`` rows. The numbered
shims in ``python/`` bridge that: each shim carries the SAME number as its R
twin, so the stage sequence is comparable by eye and by test.

Numbers are per-repo. ``-data`` numbering follows BUILD ORDER and is a separate
namespace from ``-raw``, so this repo's numbers need not match its sibling
leagues' — only its own R chain. Holes are deliberate and never compacted.

**Neither side is authoritative.** A failure here means the pipelines disagree
about what they produce; a human decides which is right. The messages are
written to support that decision, not to pre-empt it.

Scope: this is the contract-level guard (which datasets, which numbers). It
does NOT prove the two produce the same values — that is the output-parity
harness, a separate and heavier phase.

Portability: the engine below is repo-agnostic — it derives the league slug and
the build package from the repo layout rather than hardcoding them, so this
file is byte-identical across every ``-data`` repo that carries the twin chain.
The ONLY repo-specific content is the ``KNOWN_UNPAIRED`` block. Diffing this
file against a sibling repo's copy should show that block and nothing else; any
other difference is drift between copies, not a real per-league distinction.

Requirements for a repo to carry this gate: a numbered R stage chain under
``R/`` AND a ``python/<league>_data_build/config.py`` declaring ``REGISTRY``.
A repo with no R dataset chain (helpers or scrape stages only) cannot use this
module — there is nothing to pair, and a vacuous pass is worse than no gate.
